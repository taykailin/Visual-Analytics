## Original Data Visualization

The original visualizations display data originating from a study under **Imperial College London YouGov Covid-19 Behavior Tracker Data Hub** conducted to understand the willingness of the public to undergo Covid-19 vaccination around the world. Data can be extracted from Github at the following [link](https://github.com/YouGov-Data/covid-19-tracker). A screenshot of the two data visualization produced by one of the research scientists is provided below:

## Part A: Critic of the graph for its clarity and aesthetics
The graph is beautiful but confusing. 

*The graph is beautiful due to the following reasons:*

1. **Appropriate choice of colors**: In the legend, vibrant colors are chosenw hich are attractive to the reader. The colors are well chosen and are sufficiently contrasting. In addition, there is consistency across both graphs, where the same color was used to represent the proportion that strongly agreed to vaccination. 

2. **Graph is sorted**: The graph on the right is sorted in descending order. This arrangement is aesthetic and pleasing to the eyes. 

3. **Appropriate use of spacing**: The space taken up by both graphs is consistent. Both graphs have the same height, and the same width. Despite having different scales on the x-axis, the preparer of the graph adjusted the widths of both graphs such that the length of the first row of the right graph (United Kingdom) is approximately equal to the width of the rows in the left graph. Consistency in the usage of spacing is aesthetic to the reader. 

*However, the graph is confusing due to the following reasons:* 

1. **Color scale can be better chosen to reflect ordinal data type**: Color scale can be more efficiently used. The x-axis in this question is ordinal where participants of the study can rate their agreement to vaccination from 1 to 5. The ordinal type of the variable can be reflected in the color scale, where both ends of the scale can showcase increasing intensity (from 2 to 1 and from 4 to 5). 

2. **Visualize uncertainty of sampling**: The graph on the right (% of strongly agreed to vaccination) does not visualize the uncertainty in sampling. Smaller sample sizes have greater errors as surveyors can claim with less certainty that the sample results would be applicable to the population. In visualizing the percentage of survey respondents who strongly agree to receiving the vaccine, we have to visualize the uncertainty involved in sampling to apply the sample results to the population at large. 

3. **Unclear title of graph**: The title of the graph on the left is unclear. The title is a question ‘Which country is more pro-vaccine?’ and the respondent answer should be the name of a country. However, the graph depicts survey responses that range from ‘Strongly Agree’ to ‘Strongly Disagree’, and the reader of the graph is unable to decipher what the survey respondents are agreeing or disagreeing towards. 

4. **Poor comparability across both graphs**: In both graphs, the countries are not listed in the same order. The graph on the left has its countries sorted by alphabetical order whereas the graph on the right has its countries sorted by descending order according to the percentage that strongly agreed to the vaccination. To compare a country across both graphs, taking the United Kingdom as an example, the reader would need to look at the most bottom row of the left graph and compare it with the top row of the right graph. It would be much easier to do the comparison if they were in the same row.

## Part B: Suggesting an improved alternative graphical presentation
With reference to the critics above, the following suggestions have been proposed.

1. **Color scale can be better chosen to reflect ordinal data type**: Instead of using 5 separate colors, a color scale will be used from red to yellow to green which will represent the survey responses 'disagree', 'neutral' and 'agree' respectively. 

2. **Visualize uncertainty of sampling**: To visualize uncertainty, standard error will be computed based on every country's sample size and added to the graph. 

3. **Unclear title of graph**: For greater clarity, the exact survey question will be stated in the visualization so that the user is able to know exactly what survey respondents are agreeing or disagreeing with. 

4. **Poor comparability across both graphs**: Both graphs will be sorted in the same order of countries. 

The proposed alternative data visualization is as follows: 

<center>

![Figure 2: Sketch of Proposed Visualization](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image1.png){width=80%}

</center>

The proposed visualization will contain two graphs. The graph of the left depicts the distribution of all 5 survey responses on the Likert scale. THe graph on the right depicts the proportion of 'Strongly Agree' responses and the standard error involved in sampling. The bottom section of the visualization contains the legend of the Likert scale and filters that the user can interact with to see how the parameters 'Gender' and ' Employment Status' affect both visualizations.

## Part C: Designing the proposed data visualization using Tableau
The visualization is available in the following [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tay.kai.lin#!/vizhome/DataVizMakeover1_16117986613460/DataViz).

## Part D: Description of Data Visualization Preparation

**1.	Data Extraction from Github**

In Github, the datasets are found in the folder 'Data' and are listed by countries. For this visualization, we will only be using the 14 countries that are found in the original visualization. Each country's dataset is downloaded individually. The text files are downloaded as csv files by adding .csv to their file names. 

The metadata is also downloaded to help in my understanding of the columns in the dataset. 

<center>

![Figure 3: Screenshot of Github](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image2.png){width=80%}

</center>

**2.	Data Preparation**

Every country's file contains many columns, many of which are not relevant for this analysis. Thus, only the relevant columns are extracted and saved in a separate csv file. The columns are: 
* gender
* employment_status
* vac_1
* vac2_1
* vac2_2
* vac2_3
* vac2_6

The columns for 'gender' and 'employment_status' will be used as filters to breakdown the survey results by this parameters for further insights into how these parameters affect survey responses. While vac_1 was the survey question used in the original visualization, this visualization will also look at the other statements to give a more holistic understanding on the attitudes that survey respondents have towards Covid-19 and the vaccination. 

A screenshot of the extracted columns for every country is as follows: 

<center>

![Figure 4: Screenshot of Github](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image3.png){width=50%}

</center>

While column extraction is relatively straightforward for most countries, some countries required data manipulation for the column, 'employment_status', where it was stored in binary columns instead of a single column, such as follows:

<center>

![Figure 5: employment_status stored as binary columns ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image4.png){width=70%}

</center>

To convert the data into the required form, two columns need to be created. In the first column I used Index and Match in Excel to return the column title corresponding to the value 'Yes' for every row. In the second column, based on the rightmost character of the column title (i.e. the number in the legend), I used a lookup table to convert the symbolic numbers into the respective employment status. Both created columns are shown below: 

<center>

![Figure 6: Two created columns that are used to convert binary columns of employment_status into a single column ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image5.png){width=25%}

</center>

The data file of every country is stored into the same folder for ease of import into Tableau in the upcoming step.

**3. Importing data into Tableau**

To import the data into Tableau, I created a connection with any of the text files in the folder. This is done through the left pane of Tableau, under Connect > To a File > Text File. 

After creating the connection, I removed the text file from the main pane by clicking on the down arrow next to the csv file name > Remove. Then, I create a union by double-clicking on New Union in the left pane. In the pop-up, I drag and drop all the csv files from the left pane (as seen in the figure below), and click apply. 

<center>

![Figure 7: Creating a union of the separate csv files in Tableau ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image6.png){width=25%}

</center>

*3.1 Renaming Columns and Creating Aliases*

Columns should be renamed for greater clarity, and aliases should be created for values where appropriate. The following steps were taken:
* As all the survey question columns are stated in codes, I renamed them to their corresponding survey questions based on the metadata.
* 'Table Name' is renamed as 'Country' to better describe the column values 
* Values in the column for 'Country' are renamed to remove the '.csv' suffix
* For aesthetics, 'age' and 'household' are capitalized. 

**4. Preparing Bar Chart**

*4.1 Creating Calculated Fields and Parameters*

Create a new worksheet and rename it as 'Bar Chart'. The first step would be to create the necessary calculated fields and parameters. A parameter is created by clicking on the black down arrow at the top of the data pane > create parameter. A field is created by clicking on the same black down arrow > create calculated field. 

* Create a parameter for Survey Question: A parameter needs to be created for survey question to allow users of the dashboard to select the survey question that they are interested in and observe how the responses change. Name the parameter as Survey Question, set the data type as String and change the allowable value to List. Under List, add all the survey questions as values. A screenshot of the Parameter is as follows: 

<center>

![Figure 8: Creating a parameter for Survey Question ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image7.png){width=50%}

</center>

* Create a calculated field for Number of Records: An indicator of 1 is used for every row for subsequent computations. 

<center>

![Figure 9: Creating a calculated field for Number of Records  ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image8.png){width=40%}

</center>

* Create a calculated field for Total Count: This field helps to find the total count of all the records, and it will be used as the denominator of the Percentage in the following calculation.

<center>

![Figure 10: Creating a calculated field for Total Count](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image9.png){width=40%}

</center>

* Create a calculated field for Percentage: Percentage would be used to indicate the proportions of each survey response out of the total count of survey responses for the country. 

<center>

![Figure 11: Creating a calculated field for Percentage](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image10.png){width=40%}

</center>

* Create a calculated field for Selector: Selector would be used to indicate to Tableau under the Color marker what survey question column it should refer to. This field would be tied to the Parameter field so that the visualization would change according to what the user inputs. 

<center>

![Figure 12: Creating a calculated field for Selector](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image11.png){width=100%}

</center>

*4.2 Adding elements to the visualization*

After the fields and parameter are created, the basic visualization can be created. 'Percentage' can be dragged to Columns and 'Country' can be dragged to Rows. Drag 'Selector' onto Color under Marks.

Subsequently, the interactive elements (i.e. filters and parameter) can be added. Click on the down arrow on 'Survey Question' and select Show Parameter. Drag and drop 'Gender' and 'Employment Status' to the filter. Click on the down arrow on both items under the filter and select show filter. 

*4.3 Formatting the aesthetics of the visualization*

The final step would be to format the aesthetics of the visualization. The first element would be the colors of the legend. As previously mentioned, a scale from red to green will be used. To format the colors, click on the down arrow on the top right of the legend > edit colors. I selected the Color Palette Tableau 20, and chose red, orange, yellow, light green and dark green to represent 1 to 5 respectively. A screenshot of the legend is below: 

<center>

![Figure 13: Creating a red-green color scale for the legend](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image12.png){width=60%}

</center>

The next step in aesthetics is to format the axis as a percentage. Right click on the x axis > format. Under scale > numbers, change the settings from Automatic to Percentage and change the nmber of decimal places from 2 to 1. As the axis is also self-explanatory as a percentage, it does not need to be labelled as 'Percentage'. To remove the label, right click on the x axis > edit axis. In the field for axis titles, delete all characters and leave it as blank.

The final step in aesthetics is to format the rows so that they would be sorted in the same order as the right visualization for ease of comparability. Select the down arrow on the Country label in Rows > Sort. Under Sort By, select Field. Under Sort Order, select Descending. Under Field Name, select Prop (a calculated field that would is created under Uncertainty Graph). Aggregation would be automatically selected as Custom. A screenshot of the settings is below: 

<center>

![Figure 14: Formatting the rows so that they would be sorted in the same order as the Uncertainty Graph](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image13.png){width=30%}

</center>

**5. Preparing Uncertainty Graph**

*5.1 Creating Calculated Fields and Parameters*

Create a new worksheet and rename it as 'Uncertainty Chart'. The first step would be to create the necessary calculated fields and parameters.

* Creating a calculated field for % strongly agree: As this visualization only focuses on the percentage of survey respondents that strongly agree, I needed to extract this proportion only. For this field to be interactive such that when the Survey Question is toggled to a particular question, values in that column would appear, if-else statements are required. When a survey question is selected, then responses that are '1 - Strongly agree' in a particular column would be denoted as 1, else all other values are denoted as 0. A screenshot of the formula is below.

<center>

![Figure 15: Creating a calculated field for % strongly agree ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image14.png){width=100%}

</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Prop: Based on the numbers that strongly agree in the previous field, a proportion can be generated based on the sum of the number of records. 

<center>

![Figure 16: Creating a calculated field for Prop ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image15.png){width=60%}

</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Prop_SE: For this visualization, the confidence interval is computed at 95%. To find the standard error, the proportion is multipled by 1 - proportion. This number is divided by the sum of the number of records, which is the sample size. Finally, this number would be square rooted. 

<center>

![Figure 17: Creating a calculated field for Prop_SE ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image16.png){width=60%}
</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Z_95%: At a 95% confidence interval, Z = 1.959964 or approximately equals to 1.96. This number is input as a field. 

<center>

![Figure 18: Creating a calculated field for Z_95% ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image17.png){width=50%}
</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Prop_Margin of Error: The margin of error is the Z value multiplied by the standard error. 

<center>

![Figure 19: Creating a calculated field for Prop_Margin of Error ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image18.png){width=50%}
</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Prop_Upper Limit 95%: The upper limit would be the proportion plus the margin of error. 

<center>

![Figure 20: Creating a calculated field for Prop_Upper Limit 95% ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image19.png){width=50%}

</center>

* Creating a calculated field for Prop_Lower Limit 95%: The lower limit would be the proportion minus the margin of error. 

<center>

![Figure 21: Creating a calculated field for Prop_Lower Limit 95% ](C:/VisualAnalytics/VisualAnalytics/_posts/2021-02-10-dataviz-makeover-2/Image20.png){width=50%}

</center>

*5.2 Adding elements to the visualization*

Proportion is added to Columns and Country is added to Rows. Marks is changed from Automatic to Circle. Measure Values is added to columns. Under the Measure Values pane, remove all items except for AGG(Prop_Lower Limit 95%) and AGG(Prop_Upper Limit 95%). Under Measure Values, change the Marks from Automatic to Line. In the Measure Values Marks pane, drag and drop Measure Values to Path and remove it from Color. 

Click on the down arrow on Measure Values and select dual axis. To synchronize the dual axis, we need to synchronize the axis that has a smaller range of values to the one with a longer range of values. In this case, the bottom x axis has the shorter range of values. Right click on the bottom x axis and select Synchronize Axis. 

Similar to the steps recounted under Bar Chart, the filters and paramters are added to the visualization. 

*5.3 Formatting the aesthetics of the visualization*

To ensure that the legend is consistent, the Circle marks representing '1 - Strongly agree' need to be colored the same as that in Bar Chart. Click on the down arrow on Measure Names on the right pane > Edit colors, and select the same shade of green as previously chosen. The color of the line can also be adjusted under Marks > Measure Values > Color. I used a dark grey color to contrast against the white background of the graph, which enhances readability. 

Further formatting measures are similar to those in Bar Chart - formatting of the x-axis to 1 decimal place, sorting the graph in descending order. 

**6. Preparing Dashboard**
*6.1 Adding elements to dashboard*
To create a dashboard, click on the tab 'New Dashboard. In the left pane, adjust the Size to Automatic. Drag and drop both sheets onto the main pane side-by-side. 

For the interactivity of the visualization, when toggling the filters and Survey Question, both visualizations should adjust. To link the filter / parameter to both visualizations, click on the panel > down arrow for more options > apply to worksheets > all using this data source. For the filters, we can allow multiple values in a dropdown. Thus, under down arrow for more options, select Multiple Values (Dropdown). 

*6.2 Formatting aesthetics of dashboard*

For aesthetics, a title is added with a short description on how the user can navigate the visualization. As both graphs should take up about the same width and height, a blank is inserted above the graph on the left so that both visualizations can be aligned.
